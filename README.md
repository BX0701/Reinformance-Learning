# Reinforcement-Learning
This project uses reinforcement learning, value iteration and Q-learning to teach a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman in lab01. Lab02 further explores Temporal Difference (TD) learning using the Gym library.
Lab01
- Lab 1.1: Create a multi-armed bandit environment simulation, using epsilon-greedy for action selection.
- Lab 1.2: Provide initializes a simple GridWorld environment and sets up a value function that assigns rewards to each state based on a predefined grid.
- Lab 1.3
- Lab 1.4
- Lab 1.5: Project 3 - Reinforcement Learning - CSE511A
  This project helps much more in the learning process of value iteration and Q-learning. Click on this link to read the guidelines.
